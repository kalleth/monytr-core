# Monytr-core
Monytr-core is the backend/processing component of [Monytr](https://github.com/kalleth/monytr).

## WTF IS: Monytr?
Monytr is a single-purpose application designed to do one thing well. Tell you when your websites go down.

## A note for people
Some of this code is messy, and somewhat poor, and I'll refactor it to be high-quality once the app is released and working. This is code for me, not clients, at the moment. If you are an agent or anyone looking to hire me, remember [github is not my CV](https://blog.jcoglan.com/2013/11/15/why-github-is-not-your-cv/) and you shouldn't use this repository to influence your decision. Yet.

## HOW DO I RUN TEH APP
`$ foreman start`

## HOW DO I SHOT TEST?!
`$ rspec`
